# Aussie Weather, Oi Oi Oi.

---

A command line tool to parse through the [Bureau of Meteorology's](http://www.bom.gov.au) weather data.

Usage is `npm start "<city>"`

returns with:

`Canberra: 21.9 C ☀️  | 🌬  7 SSW | 32 💦  | Recorded at 01/05:10pm`

There are probably gaps, specifically for rurual locations, but it works for what I need.

Install with `npm install`
